SALES BEST PRACTICES:
Discovery: Ask "What keeps you up at night?" "How much lost revenue?"
Objections: Price→"What ROI do you need?" Timing→"What happens if delayed?"
Closing: "Based on X, shall we proceed?" "Next step is Y, correct?"
What went well: Good rapport, identified needs, handled objections confidently.
Improvements: Ask more qualifying questions, quantify business impact, assumptive close.
